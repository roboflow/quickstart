# Roboflow Quickstart ðŸš€

Welcome to the Roboflow quickstart repo! ðŸ‘‹

Roboflow is a set of tools to help you build a production ready computer vision workflow, fast. Roboflow empowers developers to deploy computer vision models with ease, providing utilities to help at every step of the way: from annotation to using your model in production.

Quickstart will:

1. Install all the dependencies you need to get started with Roboflow's Python package;
2. Get you set up running live inference on object detection models with your webcam in a Jupter notebook;
3. Guide you through using object detection, semantic segmentation, and image classification models in Roboflow projects and;
4. Provide you with more resources to start training your own model.

To begin:

```
git clone https://github.com/roboflow/quickstart-python
cd quickstart-python && ./setup.sh
```

A Jupyter notebook will open in your browser. Follow the instructions in the notebook to get started!
